; Program to process variable X: Load, modulo 64, multiply by 4, store.

; Initialize X (This could be loaded from elsewhere in a more complex program)
        LDI R16, 0        ; Initialize R16 to 0. We'll use R16 for X.
        ST  R16, X

; Load X into a register
LOAD_X:
        LD  R16, X       ; Load X into R16.

; Modulo 64 operation (using a loop - more sophisticated than a single MOD instruction)
; This simulates a MOD 64 operation without assuming a dedicated instruction.
MODULO_64:
        CLR R17         ; Clear R17 to use for the modulo calculation.
MOD_LOOP:
        CP  R16, 64       ; Compare R16 with 64
        BRLO MOD_DONE    ; Branch to MOD_DONE if R16 < 64
        SUB R16, 64       ; Subtract 64 from R16
        INC R17         ; Increment the counter R17
        JMP MOD_LOOP    ; Continue the loop
MOD_DONE:
        MOV R16, R17    ; Move the remainder (R17) into R16.

; Multiply by 4 using shifts (more efficient than repeated additions)
; Using shifts is a more advanced technique than repeated additions.
MULTIPLY_BY_4:
        LSL R16         ; Logical shift left by 1 bit (multiplies by 2).
        LSL R16         ; Logical shift left by 1 bit again (multiplies by 4).

; Store the result back into X
STORE_RESULT:
        ST  R16, X       ; Store the result back into X

; Halt the program
HALT:
        JMP HALT        ; Infinite loop to stop execution.

; Data segment
DATA_SECTION:
X:      .DATA 0       ; Variable X
